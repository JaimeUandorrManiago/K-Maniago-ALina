            <h1>THOR</h1>
            <p>Thor Odinson, also known as the God of Thunder is the son of Odin Odinson, King of Asgard, which makes him the Prince. Though from Asgard, he has many connections with people from Earth, being one of the strongest members of the Avengers, wherein he is the only godly being present.</p>

            <h2>Superpowers</h2>
            <p>Thor, being the God of Thunder, is equipped with very useful lightning powers he can use to zap his enemies with.</p>
            <h2>Weaponry</h2>
            <p>He is also equipped with a hammer and/or an axe only few are worthy of. They are called the "<i>Mjolnir</i>" and the "<i>Jarnbjorn</i>" respectively.</p>
        <h2>Natural Leader</h2>
            <p>Like Captain America, he is also a natural leader in times of need, keeping order with whoever and whatever type of situation he gets himself caught in.</p>

        <section id="weaks">
            <h1 id="weaknesses"><u>Weaknesses</u></h1>
            <h2>Not-So-Humble</h2>
            <p>He can take his enemies too lightly and underestimate them at times.</p>
            <h2>Non-Negotiable (at times)</h2>
            <p>He is not as good with words compared to the other members, often resulting in him making demands rather than requests, which is a good thing he has friends to help him out in this area.</p>
            <h2>Hot-Headed Manners</h2>
            <p>In the earlier days, he had temper issues that wasn't as controlled as compared to now. He would use to let his anger get to him resulting in him messing things up at times.</p>
        </section>
        
            <h1 id="ptype"><u>Personality Type</u></h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px"><b>ESFJ</b></p>
        <p>He is honest and straightforward, and even when heâ€™s not the smartest person in the room, he is always motivated to do what he believes is right.</p>
