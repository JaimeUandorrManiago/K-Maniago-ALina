            <h1>IRON MAN</h1>
            <p>Through his background in technology, Tony Stark created a technological body armor able to defend himself from armed men, all while being held captive in the middle of nowhere. This ultimately started his career as Iron Man, saving and protecting millions from different entities throughout his lifetime.</p>

            <h2>Super-Intelligence</h2>
            <p>Coming from a line of intellectual individuals working in technology, there is no doubt his intellect is way superior than that of the average being.</p>
          <h2>Super-Suit</h2>
            <p>Granting him the capabilities of flight and powerful beams coming out of his hands, his suit just keeps on upgrading throughout time, often making a more powerful suit than the last.</p>
          <h2>Combat Skills</h2>
            <p>With or without his trademark super-suit, he is still able to fight in a hand-to-hand manner, even without out-of-this-world superpowers.</p>

        <h2>Egotistical</h2>
          <p>Due to the many talents and capabilities he has, he is not able to keep his composure about these at certain times. </p>
        <h2>Reliant on Technology</h2>
          <p>His whole agenda is reliant on technology, which can be used against his will at times when these technological weaponry are hacked or damaged.</p>
      </section>
